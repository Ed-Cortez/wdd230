    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
        My target audience will be people between 25 - 80 years old who like to spend their time traveling to cities, 
        people who like to learn about the culture and history of each place they visit. I will focus on people from 
        the middle and upper social class since they are the ones who travel the most. Also this website, being in English, 
        will geographically appeal to English-speaking people. The people who visit the site will be people with particular 
        interests to know Lima, Peru, and also to know what to eat, what to visit, and where to go to have an unforgettable trip.
